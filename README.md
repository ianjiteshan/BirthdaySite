## üöÄ Setup & Running Locally

To get this project up and running on your local machine, you have a couple of options:

### Option 1: Using Python's Simple HTTP Server

This is the quickest way to serve static files if you have Python installed.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Birthday
    ```
    (Make sure you are in the folder that contains `index.html`, `effect.js`, `css/` etc.)

2.  **Start the server:**
    * **For Python 3.x:**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8081
        ```
    * **For Python 2.x (less common now):**
        ```bash
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081
        ```

3.  **Visit in browser:**
    Open your web browser and go to:
    [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

### Option 2: Using Node.js with `http-server`

If you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed, you can use the `http-server` package.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Birthday
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command will install the `http-server` package globally (or locally if you prefer, but global is convenient for this type of project).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (This uses the `http-server` dependency listed in your `package.json`.)

3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run server-node
    ```

4.  **Visit in browser:**
    Open your web browser and go to:
    [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

## üìù Customization

* **Birthday Message:** Edit the `<p>` tags within the `<div class="message">` in `index.html` to customize the birthday wish.
* **Balloons Text:** Change the letters in the `<h2>` tags inside the `balloons` divs in `index.html` to spell a different name or message.
* **Page Background Color (After Lights):** Adjust the `background-color` values within the `@keyframes peach_alive` rules in `stylesheet.css` to change the animated background color when lights are turned on.

---

## üõë Known Issues / Troubleshooting

* **"Everything showing at once":** If elements appear immediately on page load, ensure `effect.js` is loading correctly and there are no JavaScript errors. Clear your browser cache.
* **Cake / Message not appearing:** Click the "Most Delicious Cake Ever" and "Happy Birthday" buttons respectively. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors after clicking.
* **Image 404 Errors (e.g., `bulb.png`):** Check your `stylesheet.css` for correct image paths (e.g., `url('../Maal/bulb.png')`) and ensure the image files exist in the specified locations.
* **Caching Issues:** If changes don't appear, perform a hard refresh in your browser (`Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Shift + R`).
